CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB

Group A: Short Questions 
1. Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet.

 --> A protocol is a set of rules that decide how data is sent, received, and understood between devices on the Internet. Example: HTTP, FTP.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?

 --> A web browser is software used to open websites (example: Chrome, Firefox).
  A search engine is a website that helps find information on the Internet (example: Google, Bing).

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).

--> The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of web pages that are connected through links and can be accessed using the Internet.
4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
--> The  differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.

here we go; 
# Front-end Development: It is interface of website deal with user. It use the languages like HTML,CSS, JavaScript,ect. It runs in web browser. 
It mainly handles buttons, forms, images, and menus,ect.

#Back-end Development: It deeals with the server side logic of a website, work behind the scenes. It focuses on the data processing and business logic. It uses languages like 
Java,Python, PHP,NOde.js,ect. It runs on the server. It handles databasess, authentication, and APIs.

Group B:
5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
--> Client-server architecture is a model where two types of computers work together: client and server. 
-The client (web browser like Chrome) sends a request for a webpage. 
-The server (web server) recerives the request, processes it, and sends back the required webpage. 
 ( Don't know how to draw in here ???????????)

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
-->  Email: Email is used to send and receive electronic messages over the Internet. It supports tesxt, 
images, and file attachments and is fast and low cost. 

FTP(File Transfer Protocol):FTP is used to upload and download files between a client and a server. It is 
commonly used for website file management. 
VoIP(VOice over Internet Protocol): VoIP allows people to make voice calls usign the Internet instead of 
traditional telephone lines (e.g., WhatsApp calss, Skype).

7. “The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching 
works.
--> The Internet connnects many smaller networks (home, office, ISP networks) together, so it is called a 
netwrok of networks. 
In packet switching, data is broken into small packets. Each packet travels independently through different 
paths to reach the destination. At the destination, packets are reassemled into the original message.
This method makes data transmission fast, efficient, and reliable.

Group C:
8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and
requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use a dynamic website.
As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
--> No, I would not agree. A static website is more suitable because the content is the same for all 
users and requires low maintaince and cost. Dynamic websites need databases and regular updtes, which increase
cost and complexity. Therefore, a static website is the best choice. 

9. A user types www.google.com
 into their browser, but the browser displays a “Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection
is active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain 
the underlying technology that failed.
--> The problem is with the DNS(Domain Name System). DNS converts domain names (www.google.com) into 
IP addresses. Scince the webiste opens using the IP address, the server is working, but DNS failed to resolve 
the domain name.

10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does
not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet,
or Internet) they should implement and why they should use an Extranet.
--> An extranet allows controlled access to authorized external users like suppliers while keeping data 
secure. It is not open to the public and is more suitable than the Internet or Intranet for this purpose.
