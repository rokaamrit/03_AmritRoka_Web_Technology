Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.

--> A sitemap is a structured list or diagram that shows all the pages of a website and how they are connected to each other.
    It acts like a map of the website, helping developers and designers understand the site structure before development starts.
    During the planning phase, a sitemap helps organize content clearly and ensures users can navigate the website easily.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?

--> The launch phase is the stage where the completed website is made live on the internet for users to access. Its purpose is
    to upload the website to the server, connect the domain name, and ensure everything works in the real environment. This phase
    also includes final checks, backups, and making the website available to the public.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?

--> Documentation is important because it records all technical details, design decisions, features, and instructions related to
    the website. It helps developers understand how the system works, makes future updates easier, and allows new developers to work
    on the project without confusion. Good documentation saves time and reduces errors during maintenance.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.

--> The different between Front-end and Back-end develpment are;

    Front-end development: It deals with the part of the website that users see and interact with, such as layout, colors, buttons, and forms.
    It uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    Back-end development: It  handles the server-side operations like databases, user authentication, and data processing. It uses programming
    languages like PHP, Java, Python, or Node.js and ensures the website works correctly behind the scenes.


Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the
    planning phase.

--> Planning is the most critical phase because it lays the foundation of the entire website. If planning is weak, problems will appear
    later during development or after launch. Proper planning saves time, cost, and effort.

    Key activities during the planning phase include:

    Defining goals and objectives of the website

    Identifying the target audience

    Creating a sitemap to organize pages

    Deciding features and functionality

    Choosing technology and tools

    Setting budget and timeline

    Without proper planning, developers may build the wrong features or structure, leading to client dissatisfaction.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?

--> The maintenance phase is iterative, meaning it repeats continuously. A website needs regular updates even after launch.
    Technology changes, user needs evolve, and new issues appear over time.

    A website is never truly “finished” because:

    Content needs updates

    Bugs and errors must be fixed

    Security threats change

    New features may be required

    Performance needs improvement

    Maintenance includes updating content, fixing broken links, improving security, and optimizing performance, making it an ongoing process.


7. Describe the process of “Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?

--> Information gathering is the first step in web development where developers collect all necessary details about the project.
    This includes understanding client requirements, business goals, content needs, and user expectations.

    Understanding the target audience is crucial because:

    It helps design a user-friendly interface

    Content can be written in the right tone

    Features can match user needs

    Navigation becomes easier

    If the target audience is not understood, the website may fail to attract or retain users.


Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the “Testing” phase to save money and
 launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks of skipping this phase.

--> Skipping the testing phase can cause serious problems for an e-commerce website. Without testing, security vulnerabilities
    may allow hackers to steal customer data or payment information. Functional errors such as broken checkout systems or incorrect 
    pricing can lead to loss of sales. Compatibility issues may cause the site to fail on mobile devices or different browsers. 
    Testing ensures the website is safe, reliable, and user-friendly, and skipping it can damage the company’s reputation and
    customer trust.


 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap.
    Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong and how it should have been handled.

--> The main problem was skipping the planning and design phases. Without a sitemap or design prototype, there was no clear
    agreement on layout and structure. As a result, the client’s expectations were not met.

    This should have been handled by:

    Creating a sitemap first

    Designing wireframes or mockups

    Getting client approval before coding

    Proper planning and approval reduce rework, save time, and ensure client satisfaction.


10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the 
    exam schedules were outdated. Which phase was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.

--> The maintenance phase was neglected. This phase is responsible for keeping the website updated and relevant after launch.

    Activities involved in the maintenance phase include:

    Updating content regularly

    Adding new information

    Fixing errors and broken links

    Improving security

    Monitoring performance

    If maintenance is ignored, users lose trust and stop visiting the website, as seen in this case.
